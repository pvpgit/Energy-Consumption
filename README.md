# Energy-Consumption

The data set is under
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

Attribute Information:

1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 

2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss 

3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 

4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 

5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 

6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 

7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 

8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 

9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.



Goals:

-To develop analytics for new set of electrical sub-metering devices which measures power consumption and energy usage.

-To see if we can obtain enough insight from this data to provide economic incentive recommendations to homeowners.

-To see if the benefit of installing sub-metering devices is likely to be sufficient to justify its cost
