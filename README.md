# Energy-Consumption

Goals:

-To develop analytics for new set of electrical sub-metering devices which measures power consumption and energy usage.

-To see if we can obtain enough insight from this data to provide economic incentive recommendations to homeowners.

-To see if the benefit of installing sub-metering devices is likely to be sufficient to justify its cost
